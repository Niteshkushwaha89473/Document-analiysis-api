[e.g. correction] Line 1: Renewable energy has become a cornerstone of modern efforts to combat climate change, offering alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. These energy sources e.g., solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, are pivotal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lessening the global carbon footprint. The shift towards renewables is supported by various governments and organizations, which are implementing policies and incentives to promote their adoption. For instance, many countries now provide subsidies for installing solar panels or wind turbines, enabling homeowners and businesses to transition to clean energy systems. While the benefits of renewables are clear i.e., reduced environmental impact, improved energy security, and long-term cost savings, there are also challenges to consider. -> Renewable energy has become a cornerstone of modern efforts to combat climate change, offering alternatives to traditional fossil fuels.

While the benefits of renewables are clear i.e, reduced environmental impact, improved energy security, and long-term cost savings, there are also challenges to consider.
[e.g. correction] Line 1: One of the most significant obstacles is the intermittent nature of some renewable sources e.g., solar power is unavailable at night, and wind power depends on weather conditions. To address this issue, researchers are focusing on advancements in energy storage solutions e.g., high-capacity batteries and pumped hydro storage systems. These technologies aim to store excess energy generated during peak production periods, making it available when renewable sources are not producing power. Additionally, infrastructure upgrades are necessary to integrate renewables into existing energy grids, particularly in regions where the power grid was originally designed for centralized fossil fuel plants. -> One of the most significant obstacles is the intermittent nature of some renewable sources e.g, solar power is unavailable at night, and wind power depends on weather conditions.

[e.g. correction] Line 1: Another challenge is the initial cost of transitioning to renewable energy systems. Although renewables often result in long-term savings, the upfront investment can be significant eg., purchasing and installing wind turbines or setting up large-scale solar farms. For many developing nations, this initial cost is a barrier that can delay adoption. In response, international organizations, eg., the World Bank and the United Nations, are working to provide financial assistance and technical expertise to support the development of renewable energy projects in underserved regions. -> Another challenge is the initial cost of transitioning to renewable energy systems.

[i.e. correction] Line 1: Despite these challenges, public awareness and demand for renewable energy continue to grow. Consumers are increasingly prioritizing sustainability, choosing products and services from companies that use renewable energy sources. For businesses, this shift represents both an opportunity and a responsibility ie, the chance to attract environmentally conscious customers while contributing to global climate goals. In addition, technological innovations are rapidly driving down costs and improving efficiency, making renewables more accessible than ever before. For example, advancements in photovoltaic cell technology have significantly reduced the cost of solar panels over the past decade. -> Despite these challenges, public awareness and demand for renewable energy continue to grow.
