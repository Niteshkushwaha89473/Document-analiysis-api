[etc. correction] Line 1: Feature Engineering. Once the text has been preprocessed, we now need to represent the text in a way that a machine can understand. As machines reduce everything into numbers, we build a text representation by encoding it into a numeric vector. In NLP or deep learning, encoding can be considered as a mapping function that takes input in raw human-readable form (text, images, videos) and converts it into numerical vectors for computational methods to be applied to them. However, there can be multiple ways of performing encoding, depending on the task, the datasets, and the computational resources available at hand. This is where feature engineering helps. It helps us analyse the essential features and most informative parts of the input and only use those to encode the input so that we can encode maximum information in as little memory as possible. Encoding can be achieved by simple frequency-based heuristics such as one-hot encoding and bag-of-words representation. NLP practitioners these days use probabilistic, neural approaches to learn word embeddings, which are representations of words in the feature space.

In English, as well as many other languages, apart from attaching affixes, new words can also be formed by compounding existing words, where individual words, like ‘black’ and ‘board’, can be joined together to form a compound word like ‘blackboard’.

In such cases, we need to mark the relation between mouseate–cheese-drawer explicitly. Being able to state the subjects and objects in a sentence, along with the relationship among them, is known as dependency parsing. The dependency grammar describes the structure of a sentence in terms of the words and the grammatical relationship that holds between words. The dependency relations thus act as a proxy to the semantic relations in text. These binary relations consist of a head and a dependent. The head is the central word in a constituent (e.g., noun in a noun phrase, verb in a verb phrase). All other words are dependent on the head. In a dependency parse tree, the heads are linked to words that are immediately dependent on them. The main verb of the sentence is the root node from which one can follow a unique directed path to each word in the sentence. Such a parse tree is flexible with word order and is helpful in parsing morphologically rich languages as well. Figure 2.5 shows the parse tree for an example sentence ‘The mouse ate the cheese that was kept in the drawer’. The actual parsing is realised through transition-based state spaces that use stacks to create dependency structures and graph-based methods that use maximum spanning trees. -> Dependency Parsing.

[i.e. correction] Line 1: As explained before, the training of a neural network involves processing all the samples in the training dataset for which the model is optimised. Once trained (i.e., no more weights are updated), it is imperative to determine how well the model will predict on unseen samples. The dataset on which we evaluate the generalisability of a trained neural network is called the test dataset. Note we assume that both training and testing samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution. -> As explained before, the training of a neural network involves processing all the samples in the training dataset for which the model is optimised.
