[e.g. correction] Line 1: Historically, we have been following morphological rules that govern how these affixes attach to the base word. For instance, when we add prefixes, the resulting word is formed by putting together the two morphemes as-is (e.g., pre + flight = preflight). In contrast, the resulting word might not be a simple concatenation in many suffixes (e.g., ready + ly = readily). In English, as well as many other languages, apart from attaching affixes, new words can also be formed by compounding existing words, where individual words, like ‘black’ and ‘board’, can be joined together to form a compound word like ‘blackboard’. In other cases, words like ‘will’ and ‘would’ are contracted to -’ll and -’d and attached to the end of words. Identifying the various parts of a word into the morphemes that it is composed of and producing its structured representation is called morphological parsing or stemming. -> Historically, we have been following morphological rules that govern how these affixes attach to the base word.

Still, the information was insufficient to answer questions such as What did the mouse eat? or Where was the cheese kept? In such cases, we need to mark the relation between mouseate–cheese-drawer explicitly. Being able to state the subjects and objects in a sentence, along with the relationship among them, is known as dependency parsing. The dependency grammar describes the structure of a sentence in terms of the words and the grammatical relationship that holds between words. The dependency relations thus act as a proxy to the semantic relations in text. These binary relations consist of a head and a dependent. The head is the central word in a constituent (e.g., noun in a noun phrase, verb in a verb phrase). All other words are dependent on the head. In a dependency parse tree, the heads are linked to words that are immediately dependent on them. The main verb of the sentence is the root node from which one can follow a unique directed path to each word in the sentence. Such a parse tree is flexible with word order and is helpful in parsing morphologically rich languages as well. Figure 2.5 shows the parse tree for an example sentence ‘The mouse ate the cheese that was kept in the drawer’. The actual parsing is realised through transition-based state spaces that use stacks to create dependency structures and graph-based methods that use maximum spanning trees. -> Dependency Parsing.

[i.e. correction] Line 1: Building up word association and logic of distributional semantics, we can describe a Language Model (LM) as a model that learns the probability distribution over the words in the corpus. This probability is learned based on the frequency co-occurrence of words in a large training corpus. Once trained/learned, the LM attempts to predict the next token in a sequence of tokens. For a sequence of m tokens, x1, x2, . . ., xm, the LM predicts the (m + 1)thtoken, xm+1 based on the language learned from its training corpus of words and phrases. The output space, i.e., the set of all possible words that can be the (m + 1)th token in a sequence, is the whole vocabulary/lexicon learned over the language. If the LM is learned over N unique tokens, then in the worst case, each of N tokens has an equal and independent probability of 1/N for being the (m + 1)th token. -> Building up word association and logic of distributional semantics, we can describe a Language Model (LM) as a model that learns the probability distribution over the words in the corpus.

Instead, the words that can appear next are conditioned on the words that are present so far in the sentence. It forms the basis of language modelling in NLP. In layman’s terms, a language model predicts the probability of the (m + 1)th token given a sequence of m tokens seen before. Going back to our example sentence, if you are asked to predict the next word in the sequence of ‘Hello Sam. How are’, of all the words we know in English (i.e., our vocabulary), the most likely next word should be ‘you’. This likelihood is the probability spread over the whole vocabulary of which ‘you’ has the highest probability score. We will introduce the formal concepts of conditional probability and language modelling in detail in Chapter 4. -> However, from our semantic and syntactic parsing, we know that for a given sentence, not all words have an equal probability of occurrence.

[i.e. correction] Line 1: Bag-of-Word Based Representation. Forgoing the notion of conditional probability, one can still obtain a crude form of language modelling that depends solely on the constituted tokens present in the sentence. Let us consider the task of sentiment analysis. A simple method for determining whether a sentence expresses positive sentiment would be to count the favourable and negatively connotated lexical terms that occur in the sentence. The process is solely based on the occurrence of individual words and not where and how they appear in the sentence, i.e., the notion of semantics or syntax is overlooked. Such setups are called the bag-of-word approach, where we know the words in the bag but not the order in which they are placed in the bag. -> Bag-of-Word Based Representation.

From the crude analysis of the sentence vectors, we see that tokens ‘the’ and ‘movie’ occur in all three sentences and do not lead to any differentiation for the sentiment classification, i.e., we cannot tell by looking at only these two terms if the movie is good or bad. Meanwhile, the presence of ‘bad’ in S1 and its subsequent absence in S2 and S3 is an indicator of associating the presence of ‘bad’ with the label –1.
